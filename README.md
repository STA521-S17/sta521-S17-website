sta521 Spring 17
===========

Course materials for STA 521 - Spring 2017 semester at Duke University.

Course website is at https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring17/sta521/.


This web design is cloned and modifed from Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's
material for STA 101 at
https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/sta101_sp15 using the noita theme.


The directory STA521_S17_web contains code for the website that is
compiled using jekyll.  The colors are changed in the file
STA521_S17_web/noita/foundation/css/foundation.min.css
(use firebug to see colors and then edit file to add new ones;
colorpicker is a good way to find the HEX for colors)

Current color is F7786B for links and DD4132 for Headers, info at top etc
Color 98DDDE for hover link (from Pantone Spring 16)


The other directories include materials for lectures (LaTeX, R, data)


### Using this as a template for a new course

The file _noita/default.html has the "title" for the website that
appears in browsers and needs to be updated if this is to be used as a
template for a new course

The file _config.yml has the course number, header and year and
controls the top menu bar
