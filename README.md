STA521 Spring 17
===========

Course materials for STA 521 - Spring 2017 semester at Duke University.

Course website is at https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring17/sta521/.


This web design is cloned and modifed from Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's
material for STA 101 at
https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/sta101_sp15 using the noita theme.


The directory STA521_S17_web contains code for the website that is
compiled using jekyll.  The colors are changed in the file
STA521_S17_web/noita/foundation/css/foundation.min.css
(use firebug to see colors and then edit file to add new ones;
colorpicker is a good way to find the HEX for colors)

Current colors (from Pantone Spring 17)
* 5587A2 (Niagara) for links and
* 0C4C8A (Lapis Blue) for Headers, info at top etc
* 97D5E0 (Island Paridise) for hover link 


The other directories include materials for lectures (LaTeX, R, data)


### Using this as a template for a new course

The file _noita/default.html has the "title" for the website that
appears in browsers and needs to be updated if this is to be used as a
template for a new course

The file _config.yml has the course number, header and year and
controls the top menu bar
