### Description

This course introduces students to concepts and techniques of
Classical and Bayesian approaches for modern regression and predictive
modelling.  The course will blend theory and application using a range
of examples.  Topics include exploratory data analysis techniques and
visualization of data, multiple linear regression and model building,
predictive distributions, penalized and Bayesian estimation, model
selection and model uncertainty including variable transformations,
variable selection, and Bayesian model averaging, diagnostics and
model checking, robust estimation, and hierarchical models.


All students should be comfortable with linear/matrix algebra and
mathematical statistics at the level of STA 611 (Statistical Inference
- Casella and Berger is an excellent resource) and familiar with the R
programming language and should be familiar with linear regression.
Students should be familiar have taken the introduction to Bayesian inference
STA 360/601/602 or are currently co-registered in the course.  Please
see me if you have questions about the pre-requisites.
