### Course goals & objectives:

This course introduces students to concepts and techniques of
Classical and Bayesian approaches for modern regression and predictive
modelling.  The course will blend theory and application using a range
of examples.


It is expected that students have either taken STA 601 or 602,  are
co-registed, or are familiar with some basics of Bayesian analysis and
are very quick studies!  We will introduce JAGS to simplify modelling
and use a range of R packages to support computing.

All students should be comfortable with linear algebra and
mathematical statistics at the level of STA 532/611.  Resources for
reviewing linear algebra are under the Resource tab.


The course goals are as follows:

1. Understand the different philosophical approaches to prediction and
statistical inference (Bayesian and frequentists)
2. Build a solid foundation for the statistical theory for predictive
modelling and inference
3. Build appropriate statistical models,
perform data analysis using appropriate software, and communicate
results without use of statistical jargon using reproducible methods.
4. Use of simulation to characterize properties
of statistical methods.

### Grading:


<div style="padding-left:2em;padding-top:1em;">
<table style="width:400px;">
<tr> <td> Homework              </td> <td> 30% </td></tr>
<tr> <td> Midterm I        </td> <td> 20% </td></tr>
<tr> <td> Midterm II         </td> <td> 20% </td></tr>
<tr> <td> Final Data Analysis Project  </td> <td> 20% </td></tr>
<tr> <td> Participation        </td> <td> 10% </td></tr>

</table>
</div>


Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. The more evidence there is that the class has mastered the material, the more generous the curve will be.

* * *


### Statistical Analysis:

 We will use R as a programming language for data analysis and use
  existing packages written in R to support the course in addition to
  Bayesian computation using JAGS. You should have access to a laptop
  or desktop capable of running [R or
  RStudio]({{site.baseurl}}/resources).  We will also provide access
  to a dedicated server running RStudio Pro for all students that will
  have a unified environment.  See the
  [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources) page for books and other
  reseources for learning R.


### Homework:

  Assignments are in the [Course Calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/calendar). These will be assigned weekly.

The objective of the problem sets is to help you develop a more in-depth understanding of the material and help you prepare for exams and projects. Grading will be based on completeness as well as accuracy. 
The assignments  will be a mix of individual and coding team based 
assignments



**Submission instructions:** You will submit your HW on Sakai by
  uploading a PDF or through the Course Organization repo on
  github for your team.

All assignments will be time stamped and late work will be penalized based on this time stamp (see late work policy below).



* Late work policy for Homework:
    * next day: lose 50% of points
    * later than next day: lose all points


* Regrade requests must be made **within 3 days** of when the assignment is returned, and must be submitted in writing. These will be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade changes after the final exam.


### Final Data Analysis Project

The objective of the Project is to give you real-world
research experience using real data and statistical methods.  You will
use all (relevant) techniques learned in this class or explore
additional advanced material to solve a problem, explore its
properties (either analytically or through simulation) and present it
using reporducible methods.


Further details  will be provided as due dates approach.

### Exams:

There will be two midterms  in this class. See [course info]({{site.baseurl}}/#exams) for dates and times of the exams. 
You are allowed to use one sheet of notes (``cheat sheet") on the
midterm exam. This sheet must be no larger than 8 1/2 x 11,
and **must be prepared by you**. You may use both sides of the sheet
and can write as small as you wish.

* * *


#### <a name="exams"></a>Key Dates:

See the Course Calendar for dates for the Midterms and other
assignments.  If MSS students have more than 3 exams in one week,
please notify me as soon as possible, so that we may adjust timing if possible. 


* * *


### Attendance & Participation:

You are expected to be present at class meeting and actively
participate in the discussion. Your attendance and participation
during class, as well as your activity on the discussion forum on
piazza, and in commits on github will make up 10% of your grade in this class. While I might
sometimes call on you during the class discussion, it is your
responsibility to be an active participant without being called on.



* * *

### Email and Discussion Forums

We will be using
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/duke/spring2017/sta52101s17/home) for class
discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing
questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your
questions on Piazza (peer answers earn participation points!). If you
have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
team@piazza.com.



Any non-personal questions related to the material covered in class,
problem sets, labs, projects, etc. should be posted on Piazza.
Before posting a new question please make sure to check if your question has already been answered. The TAs and myself will be answering questions on the forum daily and all students are expected to answer questions as well. Please use informative titles for your posts.

Note that it is more efficient to answer most statistical questions
``in person" so make use of Office Hours.

### Students with disabilities:

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact the [Student Disability Access Office](http://www.access.duke.edu/students/requesting/index.php) at (919) 668-1267 as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations can be made.

### Academic integrity:

Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity. Cheating on exams and quizzes, plagiarism on homework assignments and projects, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the [Duke Community Standard](http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/dcs), and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved as well as being reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct). Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade. Please review the [Duke's Academic Dishonesty policies](http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/academicdishonesty).

* Use of disallowed materials (textbook, class notes, web references, any form of communication with classmates or other persons, etc.) during exams will not be tolerated. This will result in a 0 on the exam for all students involved, possible failure of the course, and will be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct). If you have any questions about whether something is or is not allowed, ask me beforehand.


* Reuse and building upon ideas or code are major parts of modern open-source
software development. As a professional data scientist you will often
build on the code of others. This class is structured such that all solutions are public. You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. I won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.

However, please respect the terms of use and/or license of any code you find,
and if you reimplement or duplicate an algorithm or code from
elsewhere, credit the original source with an inline comment.
