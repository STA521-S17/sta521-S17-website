Read in Animal data from MASS.  The data set contains measurements on body weight and brain weight.

Let's try to predict brain weight (size) from body weight.

```{r}
library(MASS)
data(Animals)
brain.lm = lm(brain ~ body, data=Animals)
```


Create some residual plots to check assumptions:

```{r}
# add code here run
```

your findings?

Examine outliers and refit model (recall subset argument for `lm`)  eliminating any outliers adding your code here

```{r}
# outlier identification
```


Continue until assumptions of normality and no outliers seems OK.

```{r}
# final model ?
```

## Findings
