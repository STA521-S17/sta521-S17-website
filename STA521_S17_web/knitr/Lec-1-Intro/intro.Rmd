## Groups

* Team based  data analysis assignments
    + Roughly weekly assignments
    + 10 - 20 hours of work each
    + Peer review at the end
* Periodic individual assignments for concepts/theory



* Expectations and roles
    + Everyone is expected to contribute equally
    + Everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in
    + Individual contribution evaluated by peer assessment


## Policies {.smaller}
* Duke Community Standard
    + I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors
    + I will conduct myself honourably in all of my endeavors; and
    + I will act if the standard is compromised
* Plagiarism
    + Use online resources (Stackexchange, etc) but make sure to cite them   (code or theory)
    + No direct code sharing between groups / individuals
* Coding Homework
    + Group based, everyone is equally responsible
* Late Homework Policy:
    + One day  -50%
    + Two or More 0%
* 2 In-Class Midterms



## Reproducible Research / Data Analysis

##  Data Science

##  Modern Regression & Predictive Modelling 

* Response variable $Y_i$
* Inputs $X_i$   (vector)
* Goals:
    + learn a model to **predict** $Y_i$ given $X_i$ at new inputs $X_i$  
    + understand relationship between $X_i$ and $Y_i$  (**inference**) 
    
## Course Expectations

*  Expect to deal with simple to increasingly messy data  (real world)
* Writing `R` and `JAGS` code that is reproducible
* self-documented using `Rmarkdown`
* use of version control (git) for team based reproducible coding

## Course Topics
*  Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Linear Regression 
  * Diagnostics and model checking
  * Predictive Distributions
* Model Selection including variable selection, variable transformations, distribution choices 
* Model Uncertainty (Bayesian Model Averaging and other Ensemble Methods)
* Bayesian Shrinkage and Penalized Likelihood Estimation (Ridge Regression/ LASSO/ Horseshoe )
* Robust Estimation
* Classification  and Tree Based Models
* Nonparametric Regression Methods 

##  Themes

* Interpretability versus predictive performance
* Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* In sample versus out-of-sample
* point estimates versus uncertainty quantification
* exact analysis versus appproximation  (computational scaling)
* understanding structure of data (relationships)
* Bayesian versus Frequentist ?

Tradeoffs...

*All models are wrong, but some may be useful* George Box

## Philosophy

* for many problems Frequentist and Bayesian methods will give
  similar answers (more a matter of taste in interpretation)
  * For small problems, Bayesian methods allow us to incorporate
    prior information which provides better calibrated answers
  * for problems with complex designs and/or missing data Bayesian
    methods are often better easier to implement (do not need to rely
    on asymptotics)
* For problems involving hypothesis testing or model selection
  Frequentist and Bayesian methods can be strikingly different.
* Frequentist methods often faster (particularly with ``big
  data'') so great for exploratory analysis and for building a
  *data-sense*
* Bayesian methods sit on top of Frequentist Likelihood

Important to understand advantages and problems of each perspective!

## Ovarian Cancer Risk Prediction

* Binary Outcome (Cancer/Control)
  * 17 established SNPS (genetic markers)
  * other risk factors (age, family history, oral contraceptive use, number of pregnancies ...)
* Case - Control design
* variability across study sites  (random effects)
* 80\% subjects had at least one variable with missing data
* Missing at random versus missing not-at-random
* Focus is on prediction, but still need an interpretable model
  
EDA, Model Building, and Predictive Checking crucial
